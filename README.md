# Analysis of Top 50 Fast-Food Chains in the USA

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the top 50 fast-food chains in the United States. Utilizing a dataset that includes various metrics such as total units, sales figures, and average sales per unit, I developed a Power BI dashboard to visualize the data and extract valuable insights into the fast-food industry. The visualizations provide an in-depth look at the performance of different fast-food chains, their distribution of stores, and their financial performance.

## Files Included

- **Top 50 Fast-Food Chains in USA.csv**: The dataset used for the analysis. This CSV file contains detailed information about the top 50 fast-food chains, including the number of units, sales in millions, and other relevant data.
  
- **Fast-Foods Stores Analysis-1.pbix**: The Power BI file that contains the dashboard created for this analysis. It includes various visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and tables to present the data effectively.

- **Fast-Foods Stores Analysis-1.png**: A screenshot of the Power BI dashboard, providing a quick view of the insights drawn from the data.

## Visualizations

The Power BI dashboard includes the following visualizations:

1. **Total Units by Fast-Food Chains**: A bar chart displaying the total number of units for each fast-food chain. Subway leads with the highest number of units, followed by Starbucks and McDonald's.

2. **Sales (Million USD)**: A bar chart showing the sales in millions of U.S. dollars. McDonald's dominates with $46 billion in sales, followed by Starbucks with $24 billion.

3. **Average Sales per Unit (Thousands USD)**: A bar chart illustrating the average sales per unit. Chick-fil-A stands out with the highest average sales per unit.

4. **Distribution of Stores**: A pie chart that breaks down the distribution of franchised stores versus company-owned stores.

5. **Company Stores**: A bar chart listing the number of company-owned stores for various fast-food chains, with Starbucks having the largest number.

6. **Units Change (2020)**: A table that displays the change in the number of units for each fast-food chain from 2020 to 2021, showing growth trends across the industry.

## Insights

- **Subway and Starbucks** are the leaders in terms of the number of units, with Subway having more than 21,000 units.
